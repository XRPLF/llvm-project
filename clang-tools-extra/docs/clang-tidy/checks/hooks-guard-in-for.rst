hooks-guard-in-for
==================

Consider the following for-loop in C:

.. code-block:: c
  
  #define GUARD(maxiter) _g(__LINE__, (maxiter)+1)

  for (int i = 0; GUARD(3), i < 3; ++i)

To satisfy the guard rule when using a for-loop in C guard should be 
place either in the condition part of the loop, or as a first call in loop body, e.g.

.. code-block:: c

  for(int i = 0; i < 3; ++i) {
    GUARD(3);
  }

In case of nested loops, the guard limit value should be 
multiplied by a number of iterations in each loop, e.g.

.. code-block:: c
  for(int i = 0; GUARD(3), i < 3; ++i) {
    for (int j = 0; GUARD(17), j < 5; ++j)
  }

``(most descendant loop iterations + 1) * (each parent loops iterations) - 1``

This checker will also calculate the GUARD limit and show a hint with proposed value 
next to a warning. Calculation is based on for loop parameters: init value, condition 
limit and loop increment. There are few requirements for the calculation to be 
performed correctly:
- loop index must be initialized inside the init part of the loop (however the 
  variable can be declared outside of the for loop)
- there must be a proper condition limit set in the condition part of the loop, or a 
  GUARD call must placed there (in which case the GUARD limit calculation of nested 
  loops will be based on it)
- there must be a proper increment defined (e.g. i++, i += 2, i = i * 2)
- loop condition can contain multiple logical expressions, like "i < 2 && k > 3" or "k < 3, i < 2"
  however in case of the "," operator it is not verified whether the part with loop 
  index is on the right hand side of the operator
- there can be more than one variable initialized in the init part of the for loop
- in case of nested for loops GUARD limit is calculated only from parent for loops 
  parameters (or existing GUARD calls), any other statements (if, while, etc.) are ignored
- if GUARD call is placed in a parent for loop it's value is used to calculate 
  the GUARD limit for nested loops - it will not be check whether the GUARD value 
  placed by the programmer is correct
- for loop init, condition limit and increment values must be either integer literals or
  const int variables, so that their values can be evaluated during compile time - they 
  cannot be expressions like i = 5 + 4, etc.
